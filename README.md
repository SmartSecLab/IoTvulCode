# Vulnerability detection in IoT operating systems and applications analyzing open-source code:


## Dataset extraction approach for IoT vulnerability analysis:
The proposed method for vulnerability data collection is as follows:

![framework](figure/framework.jpg?raw=true "The proposed framework for vulnerability data collection")


## Method for IoT vulnerability detection:
The novel vulnerability detection approach in IoT OSs and applications:

![framework](figure/MLframework.jpg?raw=true "The proposed method for vulnerability detection in IoT OSs and applications")


## Query to search IoT related source-code OSs and applications in CVE records:

_IoT_  OR _Internet of Things_ OR _Raspberry Pi_ OR  _Jetson_ OR _Smart Grid_ OR _Smart Environments_ 
OR _Arduino_ OR _Banana Pi_ OR _Zigbee_
AND
_..._


## Requirements:
The file _requirements.txt_ has all the dependencies of python packages, generated by

`pipreqs --ignore data`

### Create a virtual environment using conda

`conda create -n iotCode python` \
`conda activate iotCode` \
`pip install pip==23.0` \
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
