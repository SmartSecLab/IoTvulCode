# Vulnerability detection in IoT operating systems and applications analyzing open-source code:

In this study, we have presented IoT vulnerability data extraction tool and the machine learning methods to detect vulnerabilities in the C\C++ source code of IoT operating systems(OS) and applications.
The source code of various IoT OSs and applications was used to create a binary and multi-class labeled dataset including both vulnerable and benign samples.
To make the dataset more generic to the common standard of the C\C++ source code, we have selected the IoT OS, and application if there is at least an entry of the project in the Common Vulnerability and Enumerations (CVE). 
The types of vulnerabilities in the presented dataset are linked to the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) records. 


## Dataset extraction approach for IoT vulnerability analysis:
The proposed method for vulnerability data collection is as follows:

## Method for IoT vulnerability detection:
The novel vulnerability detection approach in IoT OSs and applications:

![framework](figure/MLframework.jpg?raw=true "The proposed method for vulnerability detection in IoT OSs and applications")


## Query to search IoT related source-code OSs and applications in CVE records:

_IoT_  OR _Internet of Things_ OR _Raspberry Pi_ OR  _Jetson_ OR _Smart Grid_ OR _Smart Environments_ 
OR _Arduino_ OR _Banana Pi_ OR _Zigbee_
AND
_..._


## Requirements:
The file _requirements.txt_ has all the dependencies of python packages, generated by

`pipreqs --ignore data`

### Create a virtual environment using conda

`conda create -n iotCode python` \
`conda activate iotCode` \
`pip install pip==23.0` \
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
