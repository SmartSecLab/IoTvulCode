# Vulnerability detection in IoT operating systems and applications analyzing open-source code:


## Framework for IoT vulnerability dataset extraction:
The proposed framework for vulnerability data collection is as follows:

![framework](figure/framework.jpg?raw=true "The proposed framework for vulnerability data collection")


## Framework for IoT vulnerability detection approach:
TBA


## Query to search IoT related source-code OSs and application in CVE records:

_IoT_  OR _Internet of Things_ OR _Raspberry Pi_ OR  _Jetson_ OR _Smart Grid_ OR _Smart Environments_ 
OR _Arduino_ OR _Banana Pi_ OR _Zigbee_
AND
_..._


## Requirements:
The file _requirements.txt_ has all the dependencies of python packages, generated by

__pipreqs --ignore data__
