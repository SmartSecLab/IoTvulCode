	title = {A {Systematic} {Literature} {Review} on {Secure} {IoT} {Data} {Sharing}},
	abstract = {Objectives: In this project, we aim at identifying existing approaches and techniques in the state-of-the-art (SotA) of secure IoT data sharing.
Method: To conduct a systematic literature review, we employ the most recent and widely used guidelines. In addition, we examine the SotA and the state of practice, then we synthesize the collected data, and ﬁnally present and discuss our ﬁndings.
Results: The extraction of data has led to a number of ﬁndings on our topic. In addition to revealing the most addressed domains, our high-level results and statistical numbers emphasize the publication increase and trends as well. We did, however, obtain more in-depth information on the procedures and methods used to preserve security in the data sharing environment. Using blockchain technology and smart contracts, as well as the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized peer-topeer storage system, are among them. These and other important discoveries do all contribute to an increase in secure IoT data sharing.
Conclusions: There are several points to consider based on the statistical data and discussion of the outcomes, as today’s solutions move away from a centralized strategy and towards a more decentralized approach. Based on our ﬁndings, we have identiﬁed potential research directions for future work in order to establish the most trustworthy environment for secure IoT data sharing. This might involve the combination of sharing and analytics, with the goal of determining whether receiving already processed data or unprocessed raw data makes a difference to stakeholders in the IoT ecosystem. As the statistics show that blockchain technology is widely employed to establish a decentralized solution, it might be useful to research whether there are any signiﬁcant variations between the blockchain platforms in what they can contribute or if there are any limitations. To summarize, the journey toward secure IoT data sharing has come a long way, and the security of data sharing will improve as research on the topic keeps growing.},

Moreover, we present the cutting-edge development in edge XAI structures and the support of sixth-generation (6G) communication services for IoT applications, along with key inferences.

	abstract = {Abstract
            Internet of Things (IoT) 's devices are ubiquitous and operate in a heterogonous environment with potential security breaches. IoT Operating Systems (IoT OSs) are the backbone software for running such devices. If IoT OSs are vulnerable to security breaches, higher-level security measures may not help. This paper aims to use Machine Learning (ML) to create a tool called iDetect for detecting vulnerabilities in C/C++ source code of IoT OSs. The source code for 16 releases of IoT OSs (RIOT, Contiki, FreeRTOS, Amazon FreeRTOS) and the Software Assurance Reference Dataset (SARD) were used to create a labeled dataset of vulnerable and benign code with the reference being the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) vulnerabilities present in IoT OSs. Studies showed that only a subset of CWEs is present in the C/C++ source code of low-end IoT OSs.The labeled dataset was used to train three ML models for vulnerability detection: Random Forest (RF), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The three models were used independently and RF; compared to CNN and RNN, gave the highest accuracy during the testing phase for binary and multiclass classification. RF was chosen as iDetect's ML classifier. Further evaluation was done on an unseen dataset of 322 code snippets taken from TinyOS. iDetect achieved a macro-averaged F1 score (mF1) of 98.5\% and weighted-average F1 score (wF1) of 98\% for multiclass classification, F1 score (F1) of 97.8\% for binary classification, and superior results compared to all three Static Analysis Tools (SATs) used to collect the training dataset.},

In this setting, the Internet of Things (IoT) will proliferate, and IoT devices will be included in many 5G application contexts, including the Smart Grid. Even though 5G technology has been designed by taking security into account, design provisions may be undermined by software-rooted vulnerabilities in IoT devices that allow threat actors to compromise the devices, demote conﬁdentiality, integrity and availability, and even pose risks for the operation of the power grid critical infrastructures. In this paper, we assess the current state of the vulnerabilities in IoT software utilized in smart grid applications from a source code point of view. To that end, we identiﬁed and analyzed open-source software that is used in the power grid and the IoT domain that varies in characteristics and functionality, ranging from operating systems to communication protocols, allowing us to obtain a more complete view of the vulnerability landscape. The results of this study can be used in the domain of software development, to enhance the security of produced software, as well as in the domain of automated software testing, targeting improvements to vulnerability detection mechanisms, especially with a focus on the reduction of false positives.},

	abstract = {The availability of large-scale, realistic vulnerability datasets is essential both for benchmarking existing techniques and for developing effective new data-driven approaches for software security. Yet such datasets are critically lacking. A promising solution is to generate such datasets by injecting vulnerabilities into real-world programs, which are richly available. Thus, in this paper, we explore the feasibility of vulnerability injection through neural code editing. With a synthetic dataset and a real-world one, we investigate the potential and gaps of three state-of-the-art neural code editors for vulnerability injection. We find that the studied editors have critical limitations on the real-world dataset, where the best accuracy is only 10.03\%, versus 79.40\% on the synthetic dataset. While the graph-based editors are more effective (successfully injecting vulnerabilities in up to 34.93\% of real-world testing samples) than the sequence-based one (0 success), they still suffer from complex code structures and fall short for long edits due to their insufficient designs of the preprocessing and deep learning (DL) models. We reveal the promise of neural code editing for generating realistic vulnerable samples, as they help boost the effectiveness of DL-based vulnerability detectors by up to 49.51\% in terms of F1 score. We also provide insights into the gaps in current editors (e.g., they are good at deleting but not at replacing code) and actionable suggestions for addressing them (e.g., designing effective editing primitives).},

	abstract = {Cyberattacks always remain the major threats and challenging issues in the modern digital world. With the increase in the number of internet of things (IoT) devices, security challenges in these devices, such as lack of encryption, malware, ransomware, and IoT botnets, leave the devices vulnerable to attackers that can access and manipulate the important data, threaten the system, and demand ransom. The lessons from the earlier experiences of cyberattacks demand the development of the best-practices benchmark of cybersecurity, especially in modern Smart Environments. In this study, we propose an approach with a framework to discover malware attacks by using artificial intelligence (AI) methods to cover diverse and distributed scenarios. The new method facilitates proactively tracking network traffic data to detect malware and attacks in the IoT ecosystem. Moreover, the novel approach makes Smart Environments more secure and aware of possible future threats. The performance and concurrency testing of the deep neural network (DNN) model deployed in IoT devices are computed to validate the possibility of in-production implementation. By deploying the DNN model on two selected IoT gateways, we observed very promising results, with less than 30 kb/s increase in network bandwidth on average, and just a 2\% increase in CPU consumption. Similarly, we noticed minimal physical memory and power consumption, with 0.42 GB and 0.2 GB memory usage for NVIDIA Jetson and Raspberry Pi devices, respectively, and an average 13.5\% increase in power consumption per device with the deployed model. The ML models were able to demonstrate nearly 93\% of detection accuracy and 92\% f1-score on both utilized datasets. The result of the models shows that our framework detects malware and attacks in Smart Environments accurately and efficiently.},
