  abstract = {Abstract             Internet of Things (IoT) 's devices are ubiquitous and operate in a heterogonous environment with potential security breaches. IoT Operating Systems (IoT OSs) are the backbone software for running such devices. If IoT OSs are vulnerable to security breaches, higher-level security measures may not help. This paper aims to use Machine Learning (ML) to create a tool called iDetect for detecting vulnerabilities in C/C++\,source code of IoT OSs. The source code for 16 releases of IoT OSs (RIOT, Contiki, FreeRTOS, Amazon FreeRTOS) and the Software Assurance Reference Dataset (SARD) were used to create a labeled dataset of vulnerable and benign code with the reference being the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) vulnerabilities present in IoT OSs. Studies showed that only a subset of CWEs is present in the C/C++\,source code of low-end IoT OSs.The labeled dataset was used to train three ML models for vulnerability detection: Random Forest (RF), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The three models were used independently and RF; compared to CNN and RNN, gave the highest accuracy during the testing phase for binary and multiclass classification. RF was chosen as iDetect's ML classifier. Further evaluation was done on an unseen dataset of 322 code snippets taken from TinyOS. iDetect achieved a macro-averaged F1 score (mF1) of 98.5\% and weighted-average~F1 score (wF1) of 98\% for multiclass classification, F1 score (F1) of 97.8\% for binary classification, and superior results compared to all three Static Analysis Tools (SATs) used to collect the training dataset.},

  abstract = {Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) is transforming the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) by enhancing the trust of end-users in machines. As the number of connected devices keeps on growing, the Internet of Things (IoT) market needs to be trustworthy for the end-users. However, existing literature still lacks a systematic and comprehensive survey work on the use of XAI for IoT. To bridge this lacking, in this paper, we address the XAI frameworks with a focus on their characteristics and support for IoT. We illustrate the widely-used XAI services for IoT applications, such as security enhancement, Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), Industrial IoT (IIoT), and Internet of City Things (IoCT). We also suggest the implementation choice of XAI models over IoT systems in these applications with appropriate examples and summarize the key inferences for future works. Moreover, we present the cutting-edge development in edge XAI structures and the support of sixth-generation (6G) communication services for IoT applications, along with key inferences. In a nutshell, this paper constitutes the first holistic compilation on the development of XAI-based frameworks tailored for the demands of future IoT use cases.},

  abstract = {The 5G communication network will underpin a vast number of new and emerging services, paving the way for unprecedented performance and capabilities in mobile networks. In this setting, the Internet of Things (IoT) will proliferate, and IoT devices will be included in many 5G application contexts, including the Smart Grid. Even though 5G technology has been designed by taking security into account, design provisions may be undermined by software-rooted vulnerabilities in IoT devices that allow threat actors to compromise the devices, demote confidentiality, integrity and availability, and even pose risks for the operation of the power grid critical infrastructures. In this paper, we assess the current state of the vulnerabilities in IoT software utilized in smart grid applications from a source code point of view. To that end, we identified and analyzed open-source software that is used in the power grid and the IoT domain that varies in characteristics and functionality, ranging from operating systems to communication protocols, allowing us to obtain a more complete view of the vulnerability landscape. The results of this study can be used in the domain of software development, to enhance the security of produced software, as well as in the domain of automated software testing, targeting improvements to vulnerability detection mechanisms, especially with a focus on the reduction of false positives.},

  abstract = {The Internet of Things is aimed at controlling the physical real world using a global network of heterogeneous smart objects that are interconnected through the Internet. Nonetheless, this emergent paradigm still poses challenges in terms of intelligence, autonomy, security, privacy, and interoperability, all of which must be overcome in order for this approach to be consolidated. The integration of Internet of Things with agent technologies has been proposed as an alternative. In this article, we present a general overview of the main preliminary models, theoretical and experimental studies, and applications currently proposed to carry out the agentification of the Internet of Things through modeling smart objects and networks of Internet of Things objects using software agents. Furthermore, we present an analysis of the main strengths, opportunities, weaknesses, and threats of this approach in terms of computational intelligence. Finally, we discuss the main challenges that must be overcome in order for the agentification process of the Internet of Things to become a consolidated paradigm to build cognitive Internet of Things applications.},

  author = {Tran, Thanh Thao Thi},
  abstract = {Objectives: In this project, we aim at identifying existing approaches and techniques in the state-of-the-art (SotA) of secure IoT data sharing. Method: To conduct a systematic literature review, we employ the most recent and widely used guidelines. In addition, we examine the SotA and the state of practice, then we synthesize the collected data, and finally present and discuss our findings. Results: The extraction of data has led to a number of findings on our topic. In addition to revealing the most addressed domains, our high-level results and statistical numbers emphasize the publication increase and trends as well. We did, however, obtain more in-depth information on the procedures and methods used to preserve security in the data sharing environment. Using blockchain technology and smart contracts, as well as the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), a decentralized peer-topeer storage system, are among them. These and other important discoveries do all contribute to an increase in secure IoT data sharing. Conclusions: There are several points to consider based on the statistical data and discussion of the outcomes, as today's solutions move away from a centralized strategy and towards a more decentralized approach. Based on our findings, we have identified potential research directions for future work in order to establish the most trustworthy environment for secure IoT data sharing. This might involve the combination of sharing and analytics, with the goal of determining whether receiving already processed data or unprocessed raw data makes a difference to stakeholders in the IoT ecosystem. As the statistics show that blockchain technology is widely employed to establish a decentralized solution, it might be useful to research whether there are any significant variations between the blockchain platforms in what they can contribute or if there are any limitations. To summarize, the journey toward secure IoT data sharing has come a long way, and the security of data sharing will improve as research on the topic keeps growing.},
